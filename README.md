# 🩺 DigiHealth - AI-Powered Disease Detection and Health Companion

Welcome to **DigiHealth** – an innovative full-stack web application built to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics using Machine Learning and AI-driven chatbot support.

This capstone project was developed during my final semester at **Bharath University**, with a vision to bridge the gap between symptom analysis and accessible healthcare support. DigiHealth empowers users to receive preliminary disease predictions and interactive medical guidance from the comfort of their homes.
